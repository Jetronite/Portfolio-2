      <h2>GOALS</h2>
      <p data-testid="test-about-goals">I aim to become a software engineer. I want to build powerful apps that pioneer
        the very future of our world. So one line of code at a time, one push, pull, commit after another and hopefully
        I'll be there</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Areas Of Low Confidence</h2>
      <p data-testid="test-about-low-confidence">I won't lie, it has not been easy it took me two years to learn
        frontend so I believe I will ace this frontend track, however the backend track has been hell since I started. I
        fell like getting beyound stage 5 is an impossibilty</p>

      <h2>Note To Future Self</h2>
      <p data-testid="test-about-future-note">To myself in the near future, Captain don't relent I believe you can
        complete this challeng if you ever feel down an think you suck (which infact you do ðŸ˜‘) don't relent this
        challenge is one of many that tech will throw at you. There will be nights of bugs that make no sense, days when
        deployments fail for mysterious reasons, and moments when youâ€™ll wonder if youâ€™re even cut out for this. But you
        are â€” because you show up. You learn, you adapt, and you keep moving. Stay sharp.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Extra thoughts</h2>
      <p data-testid="test-about-extra">Personally, I am happy for the experiance HNG has given me to push myself, to
        become better, to aim higher, to learn better and to become better. If any HNG intern see's this know that you
        are not alone in your struggle and we will lok back and laugh after stage 10</p>
